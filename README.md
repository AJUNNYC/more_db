Enhanced DB_Tutorial Project
This project builds upon the original db_tutorial project, adding several important features to improve its functionality and efficiency. The enhancements include a delete feature, a mechanism for freeing pages, an LRU (Least Recently Used) mechanism for loading and unloading pages, and a transition to using char* instead of the previous void* for better consistency.

Description
This project is an extension of the db_tutorial, a simple database project. The enhancements in this version aim to provide better memory management, efficient page handling, and consistent pointer usage. The project now includes:

Delete functionality: The ability to delete records from the database.
Memory management improvements: A new mechanism for freeing pages to optimize memory usage.
LRU mechanism: A cache management strategy to load and unload pages based on usage, improving performance.
Pointer consistency: Switching from void* to char* to make pointer usage more consistent throughout the codebase.
Features
Delete Operation: Implemented a mechanism to delete data entries from the database.
Page Management: Introduced a page freeing mechanism that efficiently handles memory.
LRU Caching: Uses an LRU caching system to automatically manage page loading/unloading, keeping the most recently accessed pages in memory.
Code Cleanup: Replaced void* with char* for better type safety and consistency in pointer usage across the codebase.
Installation
Prerequisites:
C compiler (e.g., GCC)
Make (for building the project)
Steps:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/db_tutorial_enhanced.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd db_tutorial_enhanced
Build the project using make:

bash
Copy code
make
Run the project:

bash
Copy code
./db_tutorial_enhanced
Usage
Insert Data:
To insert data into the database, use the insert command:

bash
Copy code
insert <id> <username> <email>
Example:

bash
Copy code
insert 1 user1 user1@example.com
Delete Data:
To delete a record, use the delete command with the record's ID:

bash
Copy code
delete <id>
Example:

bash
Copy code
delete 1
View Database Structure:
To view the current structure of the database, use the .btree command:

bash
Copy code
.btree
Exit:
To exit the program, use the .exit command:

bash
Copy code
.exit
